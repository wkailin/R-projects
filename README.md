1. [MNIST data](./Kailin_Wang_BIOSTAT615_Midterm_Project_Fall_2021.ipynb)
- Independently developed ridge logistic regression(99.6% accuracy on test data) and three-class EM Clustering(94.8% accuracy) on MNIST data.

2. [Fashion MNIST data](./fashion_mnist%20Kailin_Wang.pdf)

- Reduced the dimension of image features from 784 to 16 by using principle component analysis(PCA)
- Implemented multiple machine learning classification algorithms(LDA, QDA, KNN, Random Forest) on Fashion MNIST data for the multi-label classification task.
- Compared the accuracy, time complexity and interpretability of various models.

3. Computing Algorithms in R
    1. Optimized EM Algorithm for Multivariate Gaussian Mixture Model.
